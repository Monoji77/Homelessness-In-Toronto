To copy all the files from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/RohanAlexander/starter_folder) into your own repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
First, you'll need to clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/RohanAlexander/starter_folder
This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

2. Navigate into the repository folder
Use the cd command to change to the directory of the cloned repository:

bash
Copy code
cd starter_folder
3. Remove the existing .git folder
Since you want to copy these files to your own repository, you need to remove the existing .git folder (which contains the version history of the original repository):

bash
Copy code
rm -rf .git
This will "unlink" the cloned files from the original repository.

4. Create a new Git repository
Now, initialize a new Git repository for these files:

bash
Copy code
git init
5. Add a new remote for your own repository
Link this local folder to your own GitHub repository. First, create a new repository on GitHub (without initializing it with a README or .gitignore to avoid conflicts). Then, add your repository as the remote:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Replace your-username and your-repository with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

6. Stage, commit, and push the files
Finally, you can stage, commit, and push the files to your repository:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - copied files from starter_folder"
git push -u origin main
If your branch is named something other than main (e.g., master), adjust the final command accordingly.

This process will copy all the files from the original repository to your own without maintaining the original repositoryâ€™s commit history.

How to do this with github desktop

To copy the files from the GitHub repository using GitHub Desktop, follow these steps:

1. Download and Install GitHub Desktop
If you haven't already, you can download GitHub Desktop from here.

2. Clone the Repository
Open GitHub Desktop.
In the menu, go to File > Clone Repository.
In the URL tab, enter https://github.com/RohanAlexander/starter_folder in the Repository URL field.
Choose a local directory where you'd like to save the cloned repository.
Click Clone. This will download the repository to your machine.
3. Remove the Original Git History
You need to remove the original .git folder to detach the files from the original repository:

Go to the local folder where you cloned the repository using File Explorer (or Finder on macOS).
Make sure hidden files are visible (e.g., on Windows, click View and check Hidden items).
Delete the .git folder in the cloned directory. This will disconnect the files from the original Git history.
4. Create a New GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and create a new repository by clicking New.
Do not initialize it with a README or .gitignore (choose the "Create repository without a README" option).
5. Add the Cloned Files to Your Own Repository
Open GitHub Desktop.
In GitHub Desktop, go to File > Add Local Repository, and choose the folder where you cloned the files (from step 2).
Now, you will see an Initialize Repository option (since you deleted the .git folder). Click on Create a Repository to initialize the repository.
Go to Repository > Repository Settings, and in the Remote section, click Add to add the remote repository you just created. For the URL, use the link of your GitHub repository, e.g., https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git.
6. Commit and Push the Files
Once you've set the remote repository, all the files from the cloned folder will appear in GitHub Desktop under the "Changes" tab.
Write a commit message like "Initial commit - copied files from starter_folder".
Click Commit to main.
Finally, click Push Origin to upload the files to your new repository.
That's it! You've now copied all the files from the original repository to your own using GitHub Desktop.

Why do I not initialize it with a README or .gitignore?
ChatGPT said:

You are advised not to initialize your new repository with a README or .gitignore file for these reasons:

1. Avoid Merge Conflicts
If you initialize your new GitHub repository with a README or .gitignore, it will create its own first commit. This could lead to a merge conflict when you try to push the files from your local machine (the cloned repository) because your local repository will not have this commit, and GitHub will see the discrepancy between the two histories.

To avoid these conflicts, it's easier to:

Not initialize the repository with a README or .gitignore.
Commit and push all your local files first.
Add the README or .gitignore later if needed.
2. Simpler Workflow
Starting without a README or .gitignore allows you to:

Push your local files without worrying about extra changes or commits from GitHub.
Keep the workflow simple: you create a clean repository, copy your local files, and push everything in one go without having to resolve conflicts or integrate multiple commits.
3. Manually Adding README or .gitignore Later
After pushing your local files, you can always add a README or .gitignore file in two ways:

Through GitHub's web interface by selecting Add file > Create new file.
Locally by creating and committing a README or .gitignore in GitHub Desktop, then pushing it to the repository.
In short, skipping the README and .gitignore initialization ensures a smooth process when copying files from another repository into your own, reducing potential conflicts.
