[This repository contains data and a report analysing Daily Shelter & Overnight Service Occupancy & Capacity dataset obtained from Open Data Toronto](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/daily-shelter-overnight-service-occupancy-capacity/). Homelessness has been a hot topic since the 20th century and I intend to analyse the homelessness situation in the greater toronto area.
